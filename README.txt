IceCreamStackView tutorial 

From 'Practical Autolayout for Xcode 8' by Steven Lipton


App info: 


NOTES:

I referenced his web article:
https://makeapppie.com/2016/09/05/an-introduction-to-size-classes-for-xcode-8/

Then I bought his Kindle Book: 'Practical Autolayout for xcode 8'

This works with varying traits (regular and compressed) in orientations

He recommends reading the View Controller Programming Guide and particularly the Traits Section.  I concur.

An important note from Programming Guide:

IMPORTANT
Never assume that your app will be displayed with a specific size class on a device. Always check the size class found in an object’s trait collection when making decisions about how to configure that object.

Reference this in the Programming Guide :
Adapting Presented View Controllers to a New Style which tells you how to use delegates to programmatically over-ride default behaviors.
